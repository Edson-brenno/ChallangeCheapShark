# Challange
**This project is a challange wich were made during one course that I'm doing**
## Challange Proposal
**Practice is an essential element when starting programming studies, as it is through the practical application of theoretical concepts that knowledge is solidified. By writing code, solving problems, and building real projects, beginners not only internalize the syntax of programming languages, but also develop the ability to think logically and approach challenges efficiently.

With this in mind, we created a list of (non-mandatory) activities focused on practice to further improve your learning experience. Let's practice, then?

    Write a program that makes a request to the CheapShark games API and displays the list of promotions registered in the tool on the screen (You can use the endpoint: https://www.cheapshark.com/api/1.0/deals).**

Based on my expirience I've decited to do more than were asked. And with it I was abble to create one menu where i've done a separation where the user can see all the orfers or
if the user wants they can see only the best orfers. Also I've done one pagination based on that.
